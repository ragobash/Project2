# Gladlibs

### Explanation:

In this Heroku app, users are able to create their own adlib stories in the same format popularized by the Madlib brand! It begins with a user creating their own account with a username and password. From that point, they choose a Story Title/Category, and then they are presented with a form that contains the empty fields that are required to complete that specific story. After submitting the form, the user inputs will be populated into the appropriate fields in the story, and the completed story will be presented to the user to laugh and enjoy in the hilarity! At this point, they will have the option to save the story to their profile for later reading, or the option to delete the story entirely. If it is a particularly funny story that the user enjoys, they will have the option to publish it to a public gallery that every site visitor will be able to see.
